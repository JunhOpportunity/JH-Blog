## @tailwindcss/typography

Beautiful `typographic` defaults for HTML you don't control.

The official Tailwind CSS Typography plugin provides a set of prose classes you can use to add beautiful typographic defaults to any vanilla HTML you donâ€™t control, like HTML rendered from Markdown, or pulled from a CMS.

```jsx
<article class="prose lg:prose-xl">
  {{ markdown }}
</article>
```

To see what it looks like in action, check out our `live demo` on Tailwind Play.

## Installation

Install the plugin from npm:

``` jsx
npm install -D @tailwindcss/typography
```
